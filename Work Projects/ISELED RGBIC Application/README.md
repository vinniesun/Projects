# ISELED Based RGB LED with Embedded IC
Over the past decade, the automotive industry have undergone some significant changes. The once often overlooked interior lighting has been gaining more importance, as more emphasis has been placed on the comfort and safety aspect of the driver/passenger experience. With ADAS becoming more and more prominent, there is a need for lighting to connect with the ADAS sensors.

The ISELED (Intelligent Smart Embedded LED) Concept is BMW's way of realising this. By embedding driver IC within RGB LED package with very accurate colour calibration, the ISELED powered LEDs can create a comfortable  environment through homogenous lighting and interact with the driver/passengers.

## Overview of ISELED RGB LED Demo Module
As Everlight Electronics is a member of the ISELED Alliance, Everlight have also designed an LED package using the ISELED technology.
